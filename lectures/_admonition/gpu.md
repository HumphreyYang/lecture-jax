```{admonition} GPU
:class: warning

This lecture was built using [hardware](status:machine-details) that has access to a GPU.

Free GPUs are available on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). To run this lecture on a Colab machine, click on the "play" icon top right, select Colab, and set the runtime environment to include a GPU.

To run this lecture on your own GPU, you need to install [Google JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). (JAX can also run without a GPU, although execution will be slower.)
